I don't code.  No mirror and no partician.  WordPerfect 5.1.
I analyze it.  I had a dog.  I picked him out from a "Kennel."  
He was a "drive" of a force and my love of "firmware" as he required
A Google of a girdle to hold him back from "Kernel" Dennis Johnson in  
Nagasaki and Berlin.

Pierre's this ain't no patty wagon and cutting PEOPLE up is 
Brutality and Beastiality especially if they're just trying to be
Of service to mankind.
